# `solabi`

<!-- TODO(nlordell): badges -->

Solidity ABI implementation in Rust.

## Introduction

This crate aims to provide a comprehensive toolkit for working with the Solidity
ABI in Rust, including encoding and decoding values as well as parsing JSON ABI
generated by the Solidity complier.

## Usage

<!-- TODO(nlordell): Usage -->

## Future Work

While the core components of the Solidity ABI implementation are mostly
complete, there are a couple of features that expected to be implemented before
`v1` of this crate, namely:

- [ ] Procedural macros for Solidity ABI item generation. This includes
      generating types for encoding and decoding Solidity contract items. While
      the exact API is not yet determined, it is expected to look something
      like:

      ```rust
      #[derive(solabi::Function)]
      #[function("transferFrom(address, address, uint256) returns (bool)")]
      struct TransferFrom;

      #[derive(solabi::Event)]
      struct Transfer {
          #[indexed]
          pub from: Address,
          #[indexed]
          pub to: Address,
          pub value: U256,
      }

      fn main() {
          TransferFrom.encode_params(...);
          TransferFrom.decode_result(...);

          Transfer { ... }.encode();
          Transfer::decode(Log {
              topics: ...,
              data: ...,
          })
      }
      ```
- [ ] Derive macro for `Encode` and `Decode`

      ```rust
      #[derive(solabi::Decode, solabi::Encode)]
      struct MyStruct {
          name: String,
          age: uint256,
          occupation: Occupation,
      }

      #[derive(solabi::Decode, solabi::Encode)]
      enum Occupation {
          Crypto,
          Other,
      }
      ```
