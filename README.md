# Solitidy ABI

Solidity ABI implementation in Rust.

This is still a work in progress:
- [x] Type-safe encoding
- [x] Runtime encoding
- [x] Type-safe decoding
- [x] Runtime decoding
- [x] Parsing of Solidity ABI JSON output
- [x] Type-safe encoding and decoding of Solidity ABI items
- [x] Runtime encoding and decoding of Solidity ABI JSON items
- [ ] Procedural macros for Solidity ABI item generation
- [ ] Derive macro for `Encode` and `Decode`
